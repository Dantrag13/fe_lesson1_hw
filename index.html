    <h1>Philip Emeagwali</h1>
    <p class="bold">Philip Emeagwali is a Nigerian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist"
        target="_blank">computer scientist</a>. He has been living in the United States for many years. <sup>[1]</sup>
      He
      won the 1989 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Bell_Prize" target="_blank">Gordon Bell Prize</a>
      ($1,000) for
      price-performance in high-performance computing applications, in an
      oil reservoir modeling calculation using a novel mathematical formulation and implementation. <sup>[2][3]</sup>
    </p>

    <h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
    <p>Emeagwali was born in Akure, Nigeria on 23 August 1954.<sup>[4]</sup> His early schooling was suspended in 1967
      as a result
      of the Nigerian Civil War. At 13 years, he served in the Biafran army. After the war he completed high-school
      equivalence through self-study. He is married to Dale Brown Emeagwali, a noted African-American
      microbiologist.<sup>[5]</sup>
    </p>

    <h2 id="education">Education</h2>
    <p><i>He traveled to the United States to study under a scholarship following completion of a correspondence course
        at the University of London. He received a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Oregon State University in
        1977. He later moved to Washington DC, receiving in 1986 a master's degree from George Washington University in
        ocean and marine engineering, and a second master's in applied mathematics from the University of Maryland. Next
        magazine suggested that Emeagwali claimed to have further degrees.<sup>[6][7]</sup> During this time, he worked
        as a civil
        engineer at the Bureau of Land Reclamation in Wyoming.
      </i></p>

    <h3 id="court_case">Court case and the denial of degree</h3>
    <p>Emeagwali studied for a Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan from 1987 through 1991. His thesis was not
      accepted by a committee of internal and external examiners and thus he was not awarded the degree. Emeagwali filed
      a court challenge, stating that the decision was a violation of his civil rights and that the university had
      discriminated against him in several ways because of his race. The court challenge was dismissed, as was an appeal
      to the Michigan state Court of Appeals. <sup>[8]</sup>
    </p>

    <h2 id="supercomputing">Supercomputing</h2>
    <p><i>Emeagwali received the 1989 Gordon Bell Prize for an application of the CM-2 massively-parallel computer. The
        application used computational fluid dynamics for oil-reservoir modeling. He received a prize in
        "price/performance" category, with a performance figure of about 400 Mflops/$1M.<sup>[15]</sup> The winner in
        the
        "performance" category, was also the winner of the Price/performance category, but unable to receive two prizes.
        Mobil Research and Thinking Machines, used the CM-2 for seismic data processing and achieved the higher ratio of
        500 Mflops/$1M. The judges decided on one award per entry.<sup>[3][2]</sup> His method involved each
        microprocessor
        communicating with six neighbors.<sup>[10]</sup>
      </i></p>

    <p class="semi_bold">Emeagwali's simulation was the first program to apply a pseudo-time approach to reservoir
      modeling.<sup>[1]</sup></p>
